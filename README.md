## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Predictions and interpretability of results

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset containas relevant features such as customer demographics, usage behavior, service history, and feedback. 

## ðŸ“ˆ Models 
The following machine learning models were implemented to predict customer churn:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

K-Neighbors Classifier

Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes (GaussianNB)

AdaBoost Classifier

## ðŸ“œ Conclusion
With 90% accuracy, precision, and recall, the Logistic Regression model effectively balances identifying both churn and non-churn customers and is a good fit model. Its strong F1-score (0.89â€“0.90) ensures reliable predictions, making it a robust choice for proactive customer retention strategies.
